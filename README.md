# ftl_tools
Ruby Tools for Traveller, 2d6 OGL, Cepheus Engine, etc

For the ftl_tools gems you need to use "gem install --pre ftl_tools". This is a pre-release gem.

  gem install --pre <gem> 


To install in a different directory, use something similar to:

  gem install <gem>  --bindir /usr/local/bin


Or just clone the repo and build on your own.
